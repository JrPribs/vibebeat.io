# vibebeat.io

ðŸŽµ A browser-based groovebox (MPC-inspired) that gets anyone from zero to a solid 8-bar loop fast.

## Vision

vibebeat.io is a sophisticated music creation application that combines the power of modern web technologies with the intuitive workflow of classic grooveboxes. Create beats, melodies, and complete tracks directly in your browser with optional AI assistance.

- **Mixer**: Per-track volume/pan with master soft-clip guard
- **Arranger**: A/B patterns and song chaining
- **Export**: MP3, WAV, and project JSON formats
