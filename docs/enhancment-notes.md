## Music Theory Integration
- https://github.com/tonaljs/tonal?tab=readme-ov-file#documentation
- completely modular (super awesome for gradular integration, and only importing what we need)
- Tonal music theory library contains functions to manipulate tonal elements of music.
- should save lots of custom effort, or allow us to remove overly complex or unneccesary custom code.
